# Edu-Presentation-Maker

a humble project to create presentations from wikipedia pages, and some possible expantion to all web pages.

the work-flow is as follow:
1 - extract text from the page and divide it to paragraphs.
2 - process the text and remove any patterns of text that might affect the content generation of the presentation.
3 - generate the content, and currently we're only implementing the keypoints generator.
4 - exporting the presentation as a powerpoint file.

hopefully it can help you in someway.! goodluck ^_^

# Edu-Presentation-Maker

a humble project to create presentations from Wikipedia pages, and some possible expansion to all web pages.

`Note: it doesn't implement a full solution to all problems related to its goal.`

the work-flow is as follows:
1. extract text from the page and divide it into paragraphs.
2. process the text and remove any patterns of text that might affect the content generation of the presentation.
3. generate the content, and currently we're only implementing the keypoints generator.
4.  export the presentation as a PowerPoint file.
